# 🚀 Fix: Dependency & Yarn Issues in RocketMQ Dashboard

## **Issue Description**
1. **Maven Build Failure**  
   - The build failed due to a missing dependency:  
     ```
     Could not find artifact io.grpc:grpc-core:jar:1.50.0
     ```
   - This caused Maven to be unable to resolve dependencies correctly.

2. **Yarn Build Failure**  
   - Error: `'yarn' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
   - Error: `Couldn't find a package.json file`
   - This happened because the `frontend` folder had `package-lock.json` but not `package.json`, causing Yarn to fail.
